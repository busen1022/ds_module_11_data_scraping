# README: ds_module_11_data_scraping
This is a Data Bootcamp Homework Submission for Module 11 Data Scraping. 

In the homework, we used [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) to create two python scripts, called "part_1_mar_news" and "part_2_mars_weather" to scrape information from a website. In part 2, we also saved our data to a csv, named "mars_data." All of this is saved within the Submission folder of this repository.
